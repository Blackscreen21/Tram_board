## Personal Tramboard Site for Home

I live in-between two tram stations in Austria.
The one station is to the north of my home, the other to the west, since the major points
of my city are also in the west, BusBahnBim and Scotty both fail to show both tram options;
recommending me to wait 20 minutes longer because the entire commute is 2 minutes faster.

I decided that I want to create my own Tramboard, a simple composed departure board for both stations.
Just a website that can run on mobile and maybe on an Adurino or Raspi with an e-ink at home.

As Datasource I required the [OGD-Service-Schnittstelle TRIAS](https://www.verbundlinie.at/de/kundenservice/weitere-infostellen/faqs-hilfe/faq-zur-ogd-service-schnittstelle-trias).
(This is an XML-based Api)

This project is absolutely fantastic because I want to gain more knowledge in Angular and Node.js by building something.

So join me on my journey in automating 2 clicks :))
